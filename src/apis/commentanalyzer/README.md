# commentanalyzer

> The Perspective Comment Analyzer API provides information about the potential impact of a comment on a conversation (e.g. it can provide a score for the &quot;toxicity&quot; of a comment). Users can leverage the &quot;SuggestCommentScore&quot; method to submit corrections to improve Perspective over time. Users can set the &quot;doNotStore&quot; flag to ensure that all submitted comments are automatically deleted after scores are returned.

## Installation

```sh
$ npm install googleapis
```
